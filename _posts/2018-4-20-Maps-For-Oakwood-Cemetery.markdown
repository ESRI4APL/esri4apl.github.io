I have created 3 ERSI web apps this week. All need some further editing to be ready for full release so should be considered betas. Hoping to get all done early this week. (4/22-4/29). All apps are reflections of my views only and created with publicly posted data under a Creative Commons Licence.  (And I'll remove anything that steps on anyones toes or isnt appropriate. They are all just for public consumption and good :) 

These are the types of apps I'd like to tutor high school and college students to build in a public mapping station at the Central Austin Public Library, which is what this blog is about.

### [1. Oakwood Cemetery Historic Personsages Map](https://arcg.is/1m9Pnu "Heading link")

One for looking up historic figures in Austins oldest cemetery. I still need to edit some of the HTML in the popups and check the accuracy of the GPS

### [2. Murder, Mayheme and Misadventure tour.](https://arcg.is/1yX5zK "Heading link")

The second one Is a map tour of Save Austin Cemetaries Murder, Mayheme and Misadventure tour.

### [3. Austin Homeless Services Locator.](https://goo.gl/n1R2LW "Heading link")
I am really proud of this one and think it could do a lot of good. My plan is to build out the framework and then get some help filling in all the data during the upcoming Austin Hack For Change.
