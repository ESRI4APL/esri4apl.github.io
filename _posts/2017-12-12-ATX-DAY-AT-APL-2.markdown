I had a great time today at the Austin GIS Day event Austin Public Library Had the pleasure to meet some really cool people including Joe Faulk, APL's IT Manager (forgive me if I get the title wrong) who was kind enough to come down and talk to me about the idea of having a GIS mapping station at Austin Public Library (what this blog is all about). We had a great discussion about the game plan to make this happen. Some notes include the fact the the APL foundation will probably need to fill out the application from ESRI from their website ( http://www.esri.com/nonprofit ) since the one of the 1st thing it asks for is a tax #. Joe had the great idea of having volunteers teach classes from the station. I am all about this since Citizen Participation is my thing and I see this as a way to give citizens the tools to leverage the 

I showed my web map app for they Tejano trails and got some good feedback from Allison about how I could possibly include the location widget to make it work better on a mobile phone she was also kind enough to introduce me to David gimmick and I'm going to try to rope  them both into possibly teaching a class at the hypotical Mapping station building on Joe's idea of  having classes as a way of Outreach for the proposed station 

I really thought the presentation on flood mapping was great as well overall a really great experience with really cool people I also met Carol from the planning department of the City of Austin who was kind enough to put me for to give me some names that we could use 2 possibly help me market the Tejano trails app out to more people also 

Oh yeah! I really enjoyed and was overawed by the https://www.planet.com/ exhibit from Sarah their company launches a large number (I think 15) of low orbit shoebox-sized satellites that provide a daily image of the entire planet!!! Really cool technology and I was so pleased to find out that she is from Auburn, AL which is the home of my alma mater Auburn University so War Eagle!! to Sarah 

So overall just really pleased with the event and experience and look forward to next year's
