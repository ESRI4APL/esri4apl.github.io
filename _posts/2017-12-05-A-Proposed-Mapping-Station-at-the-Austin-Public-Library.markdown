This site is put up for advocating for a ESRI GIS public mapping station at the Austin Public Library. The arguments for this station include 

1. Public Outreach <br>
2. Student Engagement<br>
3. Crowd Sourcing of Public issues<br>
4. Adding value and leveraging the Austinâ€™s Open Data Portal https://data.austintexas.gov/ <br>
5. A meeting place for professionals and presentations
